# Movies app using Reactjs

Objective: Develop a movie search application that utilizes a public API to fetch movie data and presents the results in a user-friendly and responsive interface. The application should enable users to search for movies by their titles and explore additional details for each movie.

Requirements:

Implement a search feature that allows users to input a movie title and retrieve a list of movies that match the search query.
Display the search results in a responsive user interface that adjusts to different screen sizes, employing appropriate CSS techniques such as media queries, flexbox, or grid.
For each movie in the search results, present the movie title, poster image, release year, and any other relevant information you consider important.
When a user clicks on a movie from the search results, display additional details about the selected movie, including the plot summary, director, actors, and IMDb rating.
